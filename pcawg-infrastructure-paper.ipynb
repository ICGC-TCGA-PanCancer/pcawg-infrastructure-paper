    "This Jupyter notebook contains the beginnings of our analysis code for the [PCAWG](https://dcc.icgc.org/pcawg) infrastructure paper.  This paper describes our efforts to run the core analysis for the project, namely the alignment workflow with 3 variant calling workflows.  We built various infrastructure components that let us do this in a distributed way across many (14) cloud and HPC environments.\n",

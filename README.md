# pcawg-infrastructure-paper

This Jupyter notebook contains the beginnings of our analysis code for the [PCAWG](https://dcc.icgc.org/pcawg) infrastructure paper.  This paper describes our efforts to run the core analysis for the project, namely the alignment workflow with 3 variant calling workflows.  We built various infrastructure components that let us do this in a distributed way across many (14) cloud and HPC environments.

The main text of the paper is currently in a private Google document and will be shared with authors/contributors.  This notebook will be used to generate our figures. There may be some additional scripts in this repository if things don't work well with Python notebooks.

## Install

You can find out how to install [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) but I found it easier just to use Anaconda to install everything for me (the 3.5 version).  See [Anaconda's](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) website.

## Running

Change to this directory in your shell then execute:

    jupyter notebook

You can then load the `.ipynb` file in the web GUI that opens in your default web browser.
